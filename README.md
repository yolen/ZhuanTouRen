  "BricksMan" is a group of young people in society, they are all uncivilized behavior on social boycott. They photographed by the uncivilized behavior in society, to tell you, alert you, to promote social positive energy.

  `“砖头人”是一群社会青年，他们对社会上发生的一切不文明行为抵制。他们通过拍下社会上的不文明行为，来告知大家，警醒大家，宣扬社会正能量。`

  Today, the environment is getting worse day by day: air pollution, water pollution, soil pollution, landfill and incineration, food safety, vehicle exhaust, urban smog, waste incineration, chemical pollution, public environment uncivilized behavior, vehicle retrograde and other uncivilized behavior, are "bricks" and photographed object. Some uncivilized phenomenon, you can not see it behind the continuous occurrence. Maybe one day you go fishing, find the water is black; maybe one day, you go hunting, you find no place to go, because the forest has become a small grove; Fang Niuwa once it? Once it's in the water to catch fish? Once the river to catch shrimp it? Once the grass it? Once the eggs it? Once the tree mushroom it? Are these phenomena can only appear in the textbooks, cheating children? Are these phenomena can only be imagined by the recall? It is time these uncivilized phenomenon, appeared in public view it. Powerful impressions, perhaps we can achieve strong tips, alert and inform!

  `如今，环境在一天一天的变得越来越差：大气污染，水污染，土壤污染，垃圾掩埋与焚烧，食品安全，汽车尾气，都市雾霾，垃圾焚烧，化学污染，公共环境不文明行为，车辆逆行等不文明行为，都是“砖头人”的拍照对象。有些不文明现象，你看不到，它却在背后持续不断的发生。也许有一天你去钓鱼，发现水是黑色的；也许有一天，你去打猎，你发现没地方去，因为森林成了小树林；曾经的放牛娃呢？曾经的水里摸鱼呢？曾经的去河里抓虾呢？曾经的绿草呢？曾经的鸟蛋呢？曾经树上的蘑菇呢？难道这些现象，只能出现在教科书，欺骗孩子们？难道这些现象，只能通过回忆来想象？是时候让这些不文明现象，出现在公共视野里了。有力的曝光，也许才可以达到强烈的提示，警醒和告知！`
